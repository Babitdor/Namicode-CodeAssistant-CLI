"""Detached daemon tool — launch long-lived background processes that survive the CLI.

The ``daemon`` tool starts a process that keeps running after the CLI exits (a
detached daemon), tracks it in a JSON registry under ``~/.nova/daemons/``, and lets
the agent check status, tail logs, and stop it. This is distinct from the
in-session :class:`~novacode_cli.shell.jobs.BackgroundJob`, which dies with the CLI.

Windows-first (per NOVA.md): the child is spawned with ``CREATE_NO_WINDOW |
CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`` so it survives the console while still being able to
write to its log — see ``_CREATE_FLAGS`` for why ``DETACHED_PROCESS`` is wrong
here. On POSIX it uses ``start_new_session=True``, making the child a
process-group leader; ``stop`` signals that whole group, because with
``shell=True`` the pid is the shell and the real daemon is its child.
stdout/stderr are redirected to a per-daemon log file.

This module must NEVER ``console.print`` — it runs inside the live agent loop / TUI.
