"""Detached-daemon registry — a JSON file-backed pid store that survives restarts.

A *daemon* is a long-lived background process launched by the ``daemon`` tool that
outlives the CLI session (unlike an in-session :class:`~novacode_cli.shell.jobs.BackgroundJob`,
which dies with the CLI). This module tracks those daemons by name in a small JSON
file under ``~/.nova/daemons/registry.json`` so the agent can list, check, and stop
them across CLI restarts.

Because the registry outlives the process that wrote it, three things that would
be safe in a single session are not safe here, and each is handled explicitly:

**A pid is not an identity.** Pids are recycled, so a stale entry can name an
unrelated live process. Every entry records the process's real creation time and
:func:`is_ours` checks it before anything acts on the pid — without that,
stopping a long-dead daemon could force-kill a stranger's process tree.

**Another session may be writing too.** The registry is explicitly shared, so a
thread lock is not enough: reads and writes take a cross-process file lock, and
the temp file is per-process, or concurrent sessions lose each other's entries
(measured: 43 of 80) and can promote a half-written file over the real one.

**A name becomes a path.** Names are sanitized before they reach the filesystem;
``../..`` in a name would otherwise write a log outside the daemons directory.
