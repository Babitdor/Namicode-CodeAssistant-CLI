"""Turn a voice note sent from a remote bridge into text for the agent.

A voice note arrives as a compressed audio file (Telegram sends OGG/Opus), but
every STT backend in :mod:`novacode_cli.audio` speaks the same narrow dialect:
16 kHz mono int16 PCM. This module is the adapter between the two, so a spoken
message reaches the agent by exactly the path a typed one does.

Decoding goes through PyAV, which ``faster-whisper`` already depends on — no
ffmpeg binary on PATH, and no new dependency. Transcription goes through the
provider the user selected with ``/voice``, so a voice note is not quietly
handled by a different engine (or a different Whisper model) than push-to-talk.

Voice support is an optional extra (``pip install 'novacode-cli[voice]'``), so
the missing-dependency path raises :class:`VoiceNotesUnavailable` with an
actionable message rather than failing obscurely — the bridge shows it to the
sender, who is not at the terminal and cannot read a traceback.
